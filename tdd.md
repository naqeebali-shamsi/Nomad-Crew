## Introduction

Welcome to the NomadCrew project! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components, and workflows for the NomadCrew app â€“ a platform for creating disposable groups for trips with live location sharing, messaging, media sharing, and expense splitting.

## System Architecture Overview

NomadCrew utilizes a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. The frontend is developed with Svelte Native for a seamless cross-platform user experience. The backend, powered by Go, is composed of several microservices that handle different aspects of the app such as user management, group handling, and live location updates. Communication between services is facilitated through gRPC for efficiency and performance. The app leverages PostgreSQL for relational data storage and ...
